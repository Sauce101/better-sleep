    <h2>How Poor Sleep Quality Affects Your Health</h2>

    <p>
      According to studies from Harvard Medical School, researchers claim that missing
      as little as 1.5 hours of snooze can have a major impact on alertness. Not only will
      it affect your ability to think and process information, it can make you feel moody
      and irritated. As a result, you will become more prone to conflicts with others,
      less likely to participate in daily activities and even put your health at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, if you continue to go without quality rest, you may experience long-term
      health problems in the near future. In fact, some of the most vital snooze problems may
      lead to a higher risk of heart attacks, chronic sleep deprivation, high blood pressure,
      diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Habits That Affect Sleep Quality</h2>
    <p>Experts from BMC Public Health reveal that following poor habits in bed can also affect the quality of your sleep. Such behavior can change your room’s association with relaxation to other unhealthy activities including using your bed as a
      home office, not keeping the sheets clean, and using the wrong mattress based on your needs. This will reduce its image as a comfortable place to rest and “get away from it all.” However, there are ways you can re-master the way you snooze. You
      must first understand the importance of quality versus quantity. In fact, the key is to train the brain by creating positive habits, such choosing a mattress that will fit your needs, using your bed only for sleep, installing dark curtains, and
      eliminating noise.

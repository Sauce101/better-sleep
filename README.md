According to studies from Harvard Medical School, researchers claim that missing as little as 1.5 hours of snooze can have a major impact on alertness. Not only will it affect your ability to think and process information, it can make you feel moody and irritated. As a result, you will become more prone to conflicts with others, less likely to participate in daily activities and even put your health at risk.
